2. **Before major changes** - Tag current version
3. **Working feature sets** - Maintain in separate branches
4. **Platform-specific issues** - Keep iOS/Android branches

### Testing & Validation

## üö® Emergency Rollback Procedures

If a major issue occurs:
1. **Stop development** on current feature
2. **Identify last working checkpoint**
3. **Rollback to stable branch**
4. **Document the issue** in ISSUES.md
5. **Re-plan approach** for problematic feature
6. **Test rollback version** thoroughly
7. **Continue from stable point**

This roadmap ensures we build the BLE Emergency SOS App systematically with clear checkpoints and recovery strategies at every step.
