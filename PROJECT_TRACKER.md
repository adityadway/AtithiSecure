## 📝 Development Notes

### Important Decisions
- Using React Native for cross-platform development
- react-native-ble-plx for BLE functionality
- SQLite for local data storage
- OpenStreetMap for offline mapping

### Technical Considerations
- Keep message payloads under 200 bytes
- Limit concurrent connections to 5-7 devices
- Implement 2-4 hop maximum for mesh routing
- Use TTL to prevent message flooding
