# Atithi Secure - Development Guide

## Current Status

✅ **Completed:**
- React Native project initialization
- Core dependencies installed (BLE, navigation, maps, etc.)
- Login screen with modern UI design
- Basic navigation setup
- Dashboard screen with quick actions
- Asset directory structure

## Running the App

### Prerequisites
1. **Android Studio** (for Android development)
   - Install Android SDK
   - Create Android Virtual Device (AVD)
   
2. **Xcode** (for iOS development - macOS only)
   - Install from Mac App Store
   - Install iOS Simulator

### Development Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/adityadway/project/BLE/AtithiSecure

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Run on Android (in new terminal)
npm run android

# Run on iOS (in new terminal)
npm run ios

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Current Features

### 🔐 Login Screen
- Modern glassmorphism design
- Email/password input fields
- Forgot password functionality
- Sign up navigation
- Navigation to dashboard on login

### 📱 Dashboard Screen
- Quick action buttons
- Emergency alert (prominent red button)
- Service status indicators
- Modern card-based layout

## Next Development Steps

### 1. Asset Integration
- [ ] Add actual app logo to `assets/images/`
- [ ] Add background images
- [ ] Create consistent icon set
- [ ] Update image sources in components

### 2. Authentication
- [ ] Implement actual login validation
- [ ] Add user registration flow
- [ ] Integrate secure storage for tokens
- [ ] Add biometric authentication

### 3. Core Features
- [ ] BLE mesh networking
- [ ] GPS tracking and geofencing
- [ ] Emergency alert system
- [ ] Real-time translation
- [ ] Offline capabilities

### 4. UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Add animations and transitions
- [ ] Create consistent theme system

## Figma Design Implementation

The login screen is designed to match your Figma specifications:
- **Layout**: Centered form with background image
- **Colors**: Dark theme with glassmorphism effect
- **Typography**: Modern, readable fonts
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins

To customize based on your exact Figma design:
1. Replace placeholder images with actual assets
2. Adjust colors to match your brand palette
3. Fine-tune spacing and typography
4. Add any missing design elements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Metro bundler won't start:**
```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

**Android build fails:**
```bash
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
npm run android
```

**iOS build fails:**
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npm run ios
```

### Environment Setup

If you haven't set up Android Studio yet:
1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to More Actions > SDK Manager
3. Install Android SDK Platform 33
4. Go to More Actions > AVD Manager
5. Create a new Virtual Device

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
- Test login flow on both platforms
- Verify navigation between screens
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for navigation
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize images for mobile
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Use React Native's built-in performance tools
- Monitor memory usage during development

## Security Features

- Secure credential storage
- Network request encryption
- Biometric authentication
- Data validation and sanitization
