});

test('BLE permissions available', () => {
  expect(Platform.OS === 'android' || Platform.OS === 'ios').toBe(true);
});
```

    name: "Jane Doe",
    phone: "+1234567891"
  }
};

const invalidProfiles = [
  { name: "", phone: "123" },              // Invalid data
  { name: "A".repeat(100) },               // Too long
  { phone: "not-a-phone" },               // Invalid phone

];
```

**Persistence Tests:**

  "timestamp": "2025-08-29T10:00:00Z",
  "ttl": 3,
  "payload": {
    "text": "Medical emergency",
    "location": { "lat": 26.2389, "lon": 73.0243 },
    "bloodGroup": "O+",
    "emergencyContact": "+1234567891"
  }
}
```

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Basic SOS:** Button press → broadcast within 1 second
2. **Multiple SOS:** Rapid button presses handled correctly
3. **Background SOS:** SOS works when app is backgrounded
4. **No Location:** SOS works without GPS enabled

### Checkpoint 2.3: SOS Reception Testing
**Alert Display Tests:**

- [ ] Alert shows complete sender information
- [ ] Multiple SOS alerts handled (queue system)
- [ ] SOS alert works when app is backgrounded

**Response Tests:**
- [ ] User can acknowledge SOS
- [ ] User can respond to SOS
- [ ] Response reaches original sender
- [ ] Response confirmation displayed

## 💬 Phase 3 Testing: Communication & Mapping

### Checkpoint 3.1: Chat System Testing
**Message Delivery Tests:**
```javascript
// Chat message test scenarios

  { from: "A", to: "B", message: "Hello from A" },
  { from: "B", to: "A", message: "Response from B" },
  { from: "A", to: "B", message: "Long message: " + "A".repeat(150) },
];
```

**Reliability Tests:**
